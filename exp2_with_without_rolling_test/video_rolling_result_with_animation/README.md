In the video map, the TMA STAR routes terminate at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), specifically at waypoints 21, 22, and 23, as shown in Figure 2 of the paper. Each aircraft is represented by a larger blue point, intentionally scaled up to a size much larger than the actual aircraft in order to enhance visibility. As the aircraft approach the runway, they are only displayed when they reach the Intermediate Fix (IF), and they disappear once they proceed beyond this point. Due to the large size of the blue points, they may overlap when aircraft are close together, creating the visual impression of a collision. However, this overlap does not indicate an actual collision, but rather results from the use of enlarged points for clarity. To avoid confusion, we have chosen not to display aircraft as they move from the IF to the runway.
